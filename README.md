# Data Cleaning

data-cleaning1: perform data quality assessment

data-cleaning2: convert to appropriate data types, impute missing values

data-cleaning3: create target variable for each customer based on RFM scores.


# EDA + Feature Engineering

Since our business goal is to identify the highest value customers to target in the next marketing campaign, it's reasonable to perform
EDA before the data split for training.
